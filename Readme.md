# Meteor
First time experiment with Meteor.js.  
  
## Get Out - concept
What do you do when do want something cool to do in the morning, afternoon, evening or night and are desperate to find something fun. Use **Get Out** which suggests cool stuff for you in the neighbourhood.  
See what is available and open, check if your friends are there and check in yourself.  

### Idea
The app is a specific feature of the **Foursquare API**. I want to use the *Fun* section of places that are suggested in a user's surrounding. The user will be able to see suggestions on a map and a list. The information about a specific location will be supplied through a detailed view which shows the rating, the people present and reviews about the location.

### Features  
- Get suggetions for places to go in a list
- Get suggetions for places to go on a map
- See who is there  
- Check in to the places you go to  
- Rate your locations  
- Get information about the suggested locations

### Future features  
- Route to location  
- Suggest places to friends trough PM's  
- Get suggestions from friends  
- Add photo's  
- Add new places  
- Edit places  
- Activity feed from friends
