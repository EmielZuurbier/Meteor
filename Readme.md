# Meteor
First time experiment with Meteor.js.  
  
## Rat Race - concept
Battle you and your friends in a race to the death. Create a race, set the markers and race with your friends to the finish. The winners will be ranked according to their accomplishments. There is no order in the markers so you have to find your own fastest way.

### Idea
The app is a specific feature of the **Foursquare API**. Users will be able to use Foursquare map locations as beacons which will be used as checkpoints for a race. The beacons are don't have a linear order, so the fastest route is yours to follow.
